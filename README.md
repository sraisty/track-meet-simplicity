TrackMeetSimplicity is a web-based application built on a Flask server with a PostgreSQL database, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM. The front end templating uses Jinja2, the HTML was built using Bootstrap, and the Javascript uses JQuery and AJAX to interact with the backend. Server routes and the data model are tested using the Python unittest module.

Seed data was gathered using donated files in HyTek MeetManager format and by using BeautifulSoup to scrape results from Athletic.net.
