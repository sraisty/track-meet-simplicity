1. Create the seeddatabase with test-parse-hytek.py. Put a pdb breakpoint on 
the end of the test_parse_whole_file test, and then while it is paused, 
dump the test database to a SQL file:  
    
    $  pg_dump tms-test > seed_data/seed_sqlfile.sql

<h2>STUFF I LEARNED</h2>

<ol>
<li>Database Enums  - really cleaned up my tables and reduced the frantic 
dependencies.</li>


<li>Back_populates appears to be necessary if not using backref</li>

<li>You can actually define regular __init__ with clases derived from the SQLAlchemy
db.Model.  Within it, make sure to assign the stuff you want to be in the 
database to the appropriate column using "self":
    <pre>
        def __init__(self, a, b, c):
            self.a = a
            self.b = b
            self.wow = Transfmorgify_first(c)
    </pre>
    And this is a better alternative than a class method
</li>

<li>Raising exceptioins
    raise Exception("This should never have happened")
</li>

<li>Unit Testing - especially how to make a test succeed if an exception is 
    triggered.  
    <pre>
        with self.assertRaises(DataError):
            db.session.commit()
    </pre>
</ol>
