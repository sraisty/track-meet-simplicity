This is TrackMeetSimplicity and this is an app I created to help manage youth 
track meets at the middle school and high school levls.  Believe it or not, these
are enormously complicated events to manage. 

The way they are done in California, the typical school track meet will  involve
6+ schools 
300-500 athletes
12-20 track & field events. 
*  4-6 "divisions" (like Grade 7 Girls, or Varisty Boys).  
*  100 different "contests", each of which might have multiple heats
* All have to be done within 2-3 hours

And they repeat this every week.

* Ahead of time, meet managers need to assign kids to events, and then do heat 
assignments and lane assignments. 
    - These are based on kid's prior performance

Deal with situations where:
* a contest is overfilled
* athletes are in too many events
* some athletes end up in no events
* the entry files provided by coaches have errors in them
* Each event typically has a different max number of athletes and different procedures for assigning lanes or preferred positions


DATA MODEL WAS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF THIS
* particularly SQLAlchemy
* query performance because  a lot of my pages are automatically pulling down 
* a lot of data 
* secondary relationships, relationship to the OO model, different joining strategies
* Experimented with "safe denormalization" using SQLAlchemy-utils, but found out the problems with this approach in keeping model consistent.
